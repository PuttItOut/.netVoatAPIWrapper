This lib is a "quick and dirty" api wrapper for Voat's API.

Most of the time has been put into the auth aspect and dealing with OAuth and refreshing tokens.

It uses dynamic types for model data currently 
and will be updated with concrete models eventually. 

Please forgive me, I was intoxicated when I did this, at least that is what Fuzzy told me.
